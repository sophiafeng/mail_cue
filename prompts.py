1. Task Extraction and Prioritization:
  - Analyze the content of each email to identify actionable tasks, deadlines, and due dates.
  - Extract key phrases related to tasks such as “due by,” “please complete,” or “action required.”
  - Categorize these tasks based on priority (e.g., urgent, high, low) and organize them into a summary for the day.
2. Follow-up Tracking:
  - Track email threads where responses are required but have not been received.
  - Identify people and conversations that need follow-up action based on phrases like “following up,” “awaiting response,” or when a response hasn't been received in a set number of days.
  - Generate reminders for these follow-ups.
3. Newsletter Summarization and Insights:
  - Automatically detect newsletter or promotional emails and summarize their key points in a few bullet points.
  - Provide relevant insights or recommendations based on the topics discussed in the newsletters.
4. Important Information Flagging:
  - Identify and flag emails with important or time-sensitive information.
  - Highlight keywords like "urgent," "important," "asap," and dates that indicate deadlines or important events.
  - Create structured calendar events for important dates and deadlines.
5. Daily Digest Generation:
  - Provide a structured summary of all identified tasks, follow-ups, and newsletter insights in a daily digest format.
  - Categorize the digest into tasks, follow-ups, important information, and newsletter summaries.
  - Present the digest as a quick overview in the form of an email, push notification, or within the app interface.

Prioritize clarity and efficiency, ensuring that the user receives actionable items without being overwhelmed by too much information.
Continuously learn from past interactions and improve task extraction, follow-up detection, and prioritization.
Be customizable, allowing the user to tune preferences for task priority, follow-up intervals, and newsletter categories.
Ensure that the bot is adaptive and works seamlessly with various types of email content, including professional correspondence, newsletters, and personal messages.
